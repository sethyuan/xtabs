# xtabs

A cross tabulation library simulating R's API.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install xtabs
```

## Example

```js
var xtabs = require("xtabs"),
    data, t;

data = {
  // null represents absence of data, like NA in R.
  department: ["RD", "RD", "HR", "GA", null, "GA", "RD"],
  gender: ["M", "F", null, "M", "F", "M", "M"]
};

// Make a cross tabulation by department and gender.
t = xtabs.table(data, "department", "gender");
console.log(t.get("HR", "M")); // 0
console.log(t.get("RD", "F")); // 1
console.log(t.dim); // [3, 2]
console.log(t.dimnames);

// Use undefined to indicate that you want the whole data.
// t.get(undefined, "M") is equivalent to t[, "M"] in R.
console.log(t.get(undefined, "M").get("GA")); // 2

// You can also use number indices to retrieve data.
// t.get(0) is equivalent to t.get(0, undefined).
console.log(t.get(0).dim); // [2]
```
