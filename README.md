# xtabs

A cross tabulation library simulating R's API.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install xtabs
```

## Examples

### Cross tabulation

```js
var xtabs = require("xtabs");

var data = {
  // null represents absence of data, like NA in R.
  department: ["RD", "RD", "HR", "GA", null, "GA", "RD"],
  gender: ["M", "F", null, "M", "F", "M", "M"]
};

// Make a cross tabulation by department and gender.
var t = xtabs.table(data, "department", "gender");
console.log(t.get("HR", "M")); // 0
console.log(t.get("RD", "F")); // 1
console.log(t.dim); // [3, 2]
console.log(t.dimnames);

// Use undefined to indicate that you want the whole data.
// t.get(undefined, "M") is equivalent to t[, "M"] in R.
console.log(t.get(undefined, "M").get("GA")); // 2

// You can also use number indices to retrieve data.
// t.get(0) is equivalent to t.get(0, undefined).
console.log(t.get(0).dim); // [2]

// You can use list indices as well.
console.log(t.get(["RD", "GA"], "F").dim); // [2]

// List indices can also be in number form.
console.log(t.get([0, 2], 1).dim); // [2]
```

### Adding margins

```js
var sum = function(a) {
  return a.reduce(function(x, y) { return x + y });
};

var prod = function(a) {
  return a.reduce(function(x, y) { return x * y });
};

var t = xtabs.table(data, "department", "gender");

// This adds a row 'Sum'.
var t_ = xtabs.addMargins(t, 0, { n: "Sum", f: sum });
console.log(t_.get("Sum", "M")); // 4
console.log(t_.get("Sum").array); // [4, 1]

// This adds a column 'Sum'.
var t_ = xtabs.addMargins(t, 1, { n: "Sum", f: sum });
console.log(t_.get("RD", "Sum")); // 3
console.log(t_.get(undefined, "Sum").array); // [3, 0, 2]

// This adds both a row 'Sum' and a column 'Sum'.
var t_ = xtabs.addMargins(t, [0, 1], { n: "Sum", f: sum });
console.log(t_.get("Sum", "Sum")); // 5

// This adds 'Sum' and 'Prod' rows and a 'Sum' column.
var t_ = xtabs.addMargins(t, [0, 1],
  [[{ n: "Sum", f: sum }, { n: "Prod", f: prod }], [{ n: "Sum", f: sum }]]);
```

## API

### xtabs.factor(x, [useNull])

Returns a factor represented as a JavaScript array with a `levels` property. You may refer to R's factor to better understand it. If `useNull` is true, then `null` is counted as level too, this simulates R's _factor not excluding NA's_ behavior.

### xtabs.isFactor(o)

Checks if `o` is a factor.

### xtabs.asString(factor)

Converts back a factor to its string representation.

### xtabs.table(x, [[variable, ...], useNull])

Creates a cross tabulation.

If `x` is an array or factor, it is being used as the data source for the tabulation.

If `x` is an object with array/factor properties, then subsequent `variables` are provided as tabulation variables. For example:

```js
xtabs.table(employees, "department", "gender")
```

The above means that __employees__ is the data source (a table in fact) containing __department__ and __gender__ data, and you want to make a cross tabulation by _department_ and then by _gender_. The result in this particular case is a two-dimensional table, sort of like this:

```
                gender
department    M        F
   RD         2        1
   HR         0        0
   GA         2        0
```

For more about behaviors about cross tabulation, you can refer to R's `xtabs` function (Hence the name of this project).

If `useNull` is true, then `null` is counted too.

### xtabs.addMargins(table, margins, fun)

Add margins to a table. For a two-dimensional table, that means adding rows and columns, margin 0 represents rows, margin 1 represents columns. `fun` is the function to apply. E.g:

```
Given the following table:

                gender
department    M        F
   RD         2        1
   HR         0        0
   GA         2        0

After adding a margin 0 using a sum function, you will get:

                gender
department    M        F
   RD         2        1
   HR         0        0
   GA         2        0
   Sum        4        1

If you add a margin 1 instead, you will get:

                gender
department    M        F      Sum
   RD         2        1       3
   HR         0        0       0
   GA         2        0       2
```

You can add multiple margins at once, or apply multiple functions at once, or both. If you want to add multiple margins at once, you pass in an array of margins to be added in order, instead of a single margin. If you want to apply multiple functions, you can provide a list of function objects (See [Adding margins](#adding-margins)) per margin. Functions are applied in the same order the margins are provided.

## Class: xtabs.Table

This is what you get when you call [xtabs.table](#xtabstablex-variable--usenull), however, this class is not directly exposed to you.

### table.dim

The dimensions of the table. It's an array with each dimension's length.

### table.dimnames

An array containing each dimension's names, each one has a `dim` property indicating the dimension's name and a `names` property indicating each level's name in the dimension. 

### table.array

The array representing the table. This is underline data structure of the table.

### table.get([level | list of levels, ...])

Gets data out of the table. Basically, you pass in each variable's index or indices to get the data out. You can also pass in `undefined` as a special way to indicate that you want all the data of this variable. You can refer to the [Examples](#examples) section for the various ways to use this method.
